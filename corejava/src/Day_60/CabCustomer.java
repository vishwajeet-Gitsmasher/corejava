/*\
Three classes are given to you, 
CabCustomer
CabCustomerService
CabCustomerServiceTester


Define the following in the class CabCustomer 
private : custId int, customerName String, pickupLocation String,dropLocation String, distance int,phone String
          Generate Getter/Setter for the all fields.
          Implement the No Argument constructor.
          Implement/Generate the parameterized constructor in the order as defined above, i.e.,  custId,Name,Pickup,Drop,Distance,Phone

Define the following in the  class CabCustomerService and write logics in the following methods:
private : Generic ArrayList to represent list of CabCustomers.
public : addCabCustomer() : Add the customer object parameter to the ArrayList
			    isFirstCustomer(): Check whether the customer object parameter is already existing in arrayList. 
			    				
Note : If phone number of a customer matches with any of the phone numbers of the array list, then consider it as a existing customer, otherwise consider the customer as new customer. 
				 
       calculateBill() should calculate and return the customer bill based on following rules
       1) if the customer is new return 0;
       2) if the customer's travel distance is below or equal    
          to 4 kms then return 80 (Rs).
       3) if the customer travel distance is above 4 kms calculate bill 80 + 6 per each km.
		 Ex: Any distance for new customer return 0;
		     distance 4 return 80
                     distance 6 return 80 + 6 * 6;
printBill() which should return the bill of the customer object parameter in the following format:

            output : JOHN Please pay your bill of Rs.0.0
	             SMITH Please pay your bill of Rs.180.0

	Note : 
	   Assume one customer books only one cab at a time.
	   No charge for customer booking the cab for the first time.
	   Customer's phone number is key to test a new customer or old customer.
	   Distance should be treated as kilometers 				 
				 
A CabCustomerServiceTester is given with main() where you can create various objects and test them.
