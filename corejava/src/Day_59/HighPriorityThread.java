Question: Thread Priority and yield() Method
Scenario:
You need to understand how thread priority affects execution and how the yield() method works.

Task:

Create three classes HighPriorityThread, LowPriorityThread, and NormalPriorityThread, all extending Thread.
Set their priorities using setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY), setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY), and 
setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY) respectively.
In each threadâ€™s run() method, print the thread name and current priority.
In the main method, start all three threads and observe the output.
Add a yield() statement in the run() method of NormalPriorityThread to observe its effect.
Key Concepts:

Understanding thread priorities and how they influence scheduling.
Learning how yield() temporarily pauses the current thread to allow others to execute.
Test Cases:

Test Case 1:

Input: Start HighPriorityThread, LowPriorityThread, and NormalPriorityThread.
Expected Output: The high-priority thread should generally run before the others, but exact behavior 
may vary due to the scheduler.

Test Case 2:

Input: Use yield() in the run() method of NormalPriorityThread.
Expected Output: The normal priority thread yields control, allowing other threads to execute
